* Perform descriptive and visual analysis
* Identify insights and trends in Netflix’s global content

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** – data cleaning and manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – static visualizations
* **Plotly** – interactive visualizations
* **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis environment
